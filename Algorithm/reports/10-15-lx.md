# Types of IDSs (intrusion detection system)
	• Misuse-based/signature-based: detect by using signatures of attacks (seen attacks)
	• Anomaly-based: model normal network and system behavior (novel attacks)
	• Hybrid: combine misuse and anomaly detection

# Cyber-security data sets
	• NetFlow
	• DARPA 1998
	• KDD 1999

# Methods
	• ANN
	• Association rules
	• Bayesian network
	• Clustering
	• Decision tree
	• Ensemble learning
